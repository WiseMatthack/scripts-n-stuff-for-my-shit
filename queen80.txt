With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this
Are you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat - yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, eh
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied ?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, eh
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
Hey, alright
No I'll never look back in anger
No I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I don't wanna feel like a stranger no
'Cos I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines
I said I'd never never be angry with you
I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her
I only hope as time goes on I'll forget her
My bodies aching can't sleep at night
I'm to exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her
Love her love her love her
Come on baby let's get together
I'll love you baby I'll love you forever

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived the lie
"I love you 'til I die"
Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home
The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent
Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me

Action
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let down
Coming to this town honey is a show down
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray
Through a crack in the shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still there's a feeling this world is using me
Action this day action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day action this night
Oh you've got the power you've got the power
You've got the power to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race
But there's a heart beat pulse
That keeps on pumping
Like a juke box playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I got a feeling that just won't quit
This world is using me
Action this day action this night
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live
We can't say it ain't right
Action this day action this night

They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my hand gun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
And I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Oh you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Don't believe what your grand-daddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover in the neighbours bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire baby put out the fire
And let your sons and daughters sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire put out the fire put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead
Shoot shoot..
Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past
Life is real life is real
Life is real so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream in just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel
Life is real life is real
Life is real oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breast feeding myself
What more can I say ?
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it I can taste it
Life is real life is real
Life is real
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in ev'ry pore
Life is real life is real
Life is real so real
Life is cruel life is a bitch
Life is real so real
Life is real life is real yeah

Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out!
Pray tomorrow takes me higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Do do do bah bah bah bah
O-kay
Chippin' around
Kick my brains round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
People on streets
People on streets
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out!
Pray tomorrow takes me higher higher higher
Pressure on people
People on streets
Turned away from it all
Like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love?
Give love give love give love give love give love?
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care
For people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way
Of caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure pressure
Radio I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And ev'rything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

There's no reason for living with a broken heart
This is a tricky situation

It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one
You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
Yeah yeah
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
I try and mend the broken pieces
Ooh, I try to fight back the tears
Ooh, they say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone
How it hurts (yeah) - deep inside (oh yeah)

This life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love (ooh)
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love
Oh yeah
I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas

Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way (way)
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have friend (friend)
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside (inside)
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh - get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday (day)
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
This is the only life for me - yeah
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves
Forget all the sadness 'cause love is all you need
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourselves

Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight yeah
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall
Oh ev'ry night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays yeah
Toe your line and play their game yeah
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same (oh no oh no)
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane (oh no)
Baby now your struggle's all in vain
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder louder
What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While your waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall
It's gonna fall
Hammer..you know..hammer to fall
Waiting for the hammer to fall now baby
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall
Give it to me one more time
Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need
Is this the world we created...?
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Wooh, is this the world we created...?
We made it all our own
Is this the world we devastated, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created
God works in mysterious ways, mysterious ways
Hey, one man one goal ha, one mission
One heart one soul just one solution

And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dream, yeah
One vision
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic - no way
One dream, one soul, one prize
One goal, one golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)

Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah
My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches for to your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much
Oooh yes it hurts
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
Just surrender to your love
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows
One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time
When I was young and just getting started
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new relation
So in love but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong - you turn out the light
But inside of your mind you put up a fight
Where are the answers that we're all searching for
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good, some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse, so let's make the best of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
Pain and pleasure, ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life
All your life
Ooh ooh ooh
Pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure - pain - pleasure
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest
It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause friends will be friends
Right till the end
It's so easy now, 'cause you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand friends will be friends
Right till the end
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand 'cause right till the end, friends will be friends
Yeah, yeah
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams yet slips away
from us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever....?
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever?
Who dares to love forever?
When love must die
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today
Who waits forever anyway?

We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over - huhWho said my party was all over, huh, huh,
I'm in pretty good shape,
The best years of my life are like a supernova,
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift,
And then we took a holiday on khashoggi's Ship - well,
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed,
All in all it was a pretty good trip,
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head,
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey,
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me,
I said uh, uh, babe,
Now listen no-one stops my party,
No-one stops my party,
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party,
Just like I said,
we were phased, we was pissed,
Just having a total eclipse,
Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Oooh

If all God's people could be free to live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery

Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting

Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man,
Incredible how you can,
See right through me,
When you hear a sound,
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace,
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread.
I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you.
Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello,
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So make my mark from the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind,
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear,
I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me
When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born - oooooh
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . now!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see ?
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah
Breakthru, these barriers of pain
Breakthru, yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now! (now now now)
Oh yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah
Breakthru, breakthru
Break, hey
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you - ooh ooh ooh ooh
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Breakthru
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious - honey
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall
No problem
Uh, be cool now
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price - honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall
Flow John
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, ha, kiss kiss
Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions - honey
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall
Be cool, get serious, wooh, alright
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool - yeah
Chase me
Ooh, one more time, ha ha, I like it
Leave 'em there
Eeh dah eeh dah
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Hey scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over again
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates (oooh oooh)
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates
(Oooh oooh)
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sakes
Over and over and over and over again - yeah
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal
Yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal - yes it'll all and all happen again
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide (oooh)
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal
Turn it up a bit please

Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me

Oo ooh, ah
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh she really really really really really really aah, does me, hey
What is there left for me to do in this life
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights
Am I a happy man or is this sinking sand
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
Yeah now hear my story let me tell you about it
We bought a drum kit blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit thought we were perfect
Was it all worth it
Giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll a godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it all these years
Put down our money without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won if we lost
Yes we were vicious yes we could kill
Yes we were hungry yes we were brill
We served a purpose like a bloody circus
We were so dandy we love you madly
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this godforsaken life
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
When the hurly burly's done
We went to Bali saw God and Dali
So mystic surrealistic
Was it all worth it yeah yeah
Giving all my heart and soul staying up all night
Was it all worth it
Living breathing rock'n'roll this never ending fight
Was it all worth it was it all worth it
Yes it was a worthwhile experience
It was worth it
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
'Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin yeah
Just passing our time
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Oh oh we'll keep on tryin'
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could
ever be
Be free with your tempo be free be free
Surrender your ego be free be free to yourself
Oooh ooh
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel born to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah (yeah yeah)
And whatever will be will be
We'll keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something ?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad

It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh woh

Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad

It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - uh huh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
Uh uh ah ah

Unraveling fast it's true

But my dear, how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened - oh yes
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad!

Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'

But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Oh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I traveled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years
Yeah, ooh yeah, yeah

Without you
Woah woah woah oah yeah
I can't live without you
If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
I you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
Feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savor every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Oooh don't try so hard
Oooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a Sergeant Major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oooh
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard

Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Thing seemed so perfect - you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives - yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find
I still love you
I still love you
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible - ooh ooh ooh
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - and I like it
You get away with murder, so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite
That's alright!
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable - ooh ooh ooh ooh
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite
Ooh ooh Delilah
Ooh ooh Delilah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes
Meow, meow, meow,

And I go out of my mind - ooh ooh

You'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives
With each other
The rest of our days
Like two lovers
Forever - yeah - forever
My bijou...
Empty spaces - what are we living for?
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score..
On and on!
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero - another mindless crime.
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime.
Hold the line!
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on!
The show must go on!
Inside my heart is breaking,
My make-up may be flaking,
But my smile, still, stays on!
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache - another failed romance.
On and on!
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning.
I must be warmer now..
I'll soon be turning round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking,
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free!
The show must go on!
The show must go on! Yeah!
Ooh! Inside my heart is breaking!
My make-up may be flaking!
But my smile, still, stays on!
Yeah! oh oh oh
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies,
Fairy tales of yesterday, will grow but never die,
I can fly, my friends!
The show must go on! Yeah!
The show must go on!
I'll face it with a grin!
I'm never giving in!
On with the show!
I'll top the bill!
I'll overkill!
I have to find the will to carry on!
On with the,
On with the show!
The show must go on.
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah
It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now, mama
Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless, so hopeless, to even try
I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart
Made in heaven
Made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah

Oh, I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes, it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart
I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around
Made in heaven

It's for all to see
Made in heaven

Everybody says to me

It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever
Made in heaven

Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving it all my soul
Made in heaven

And if you're (ever in trouble) - hey
You know where I will be
Why don't you take another little piece of my life
Why don't you twist it and turn it
And cut it like a knife
All you do is live
All I do is die
Why can't we just be friends
Stop livin' a lie
So let me live (so let me live)

Oh yeah now, yeah now
Let me live
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion to
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet
Mother love, uh ha
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world, they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet
Mother love, uh ha
Mother love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother
Mother love, mother love, love, love, love, love, love, love
(God works in mysterious ways)
(Mysterious ways)
Eeeehhh, dop
Eh dop, eh dop
I think I'm going back
To the things I learnt so well
In my youth
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved, yeah, eh
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go (here we go, here we go)
We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray, hey

There's death on every page
Oh, oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved

You sit by me and everything's fine
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, yeah, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free, yeah, this world could be one

This could be heaven for everyone
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone, yes, ha, ha, ha
This could be heaven for everyone, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, wow

For everyone
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone for much too long, ooh
I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind (oooh)
I've been looking back to find (oooh) where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you - every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Woh, oh, woh, yes
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you - every time
Yes, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end
In, in, in, in the end
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

It's winter fall
Red skies are gleaming, oh
Seagulls are flying over
Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney tops
Am I dreaming

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasising
Grown ups are standing by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming

(Dreaming) there's a kind of magic in the air
(Dreaming) what a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) a breathtaking scene
(With the dreams of the world)
(In the palm of your hand)
(Dreaming) a cosy fireside chat
(Dreaming) a little this, a little that
(Dreaming) sound of merry laughter skipping by
(Dreaming) gentle rain beating on my face
(Dreaming) what an extraordinary place
(And the dream of the child)
(Is the hope of the, hope of the man)
It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky, yeah
Mountains are zooming higher, mmm
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning, and spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming
Am I dreaming
Ahhh
Ooooh, it's bliss
It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now
